How does the human mind work? We explore this question by analyzing a range of data concerning such topics as human rationality and irrationality, human memory, how objects and events are represented in the mind, and the relation of language and cognition. This class provides students with critical thinking and computing skills that will allow them to work with data in cognitive science and related disciplines.</span><br />

When something &quot;makes sense” or &quot; is organized” we are imposing or discovering order in the arrangement of concepts, events, or resources of some kind. Sensemaking and organizing are fundamental human activities that raise many multi- or trans-disciplinary questions about perception, knowledge, decision making, interaction with things and with other people, values and value creation. We will analyze sensemaking and organizing from four interrelated perspectives.</span><span class="deschide"> The most fundamental one is provided by language and culture, which shapes the perspectives one takes as an individual, in institutional contexts governed by business or legal processes, or in data-intensive or scientific contexts.<br/></span><br />
